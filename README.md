## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or later
- `pandas` library for handling Excel files
- `openpyxl` for Excel operations
- `smtplib` and `email` for email functionalities

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ReliableEmailerBot.git
   cd ReliableEmailerBot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas openpyxl
   ```

3. **Set up your email credentials**:

   Ensure you have the necessary credentials for the Gmail account you will use to send emails. Update these in the script securely.

## Usage

1. **Prepare Your Excel File**:

   - Ensure your Excel file has a sheet named 'Sheet1'.
   - Include columns for 'Company Name', 'Email', and optionally 'Phone Number'.

2. **Run the Script**:

   ```bash
   python ReliableEmailerBot.py
   ```

3. **Script Parameters**:

   Adjust the `start_row` and `end_row` parameters in the script to specify the range of rows you want to process from your Excel file.

   ```python
   process_excel(file_path='path/to/your/file.xlsx', start_row=0, end_row=100)
   ```

## Configuration

### Email Credentials

Update the following lines in the script with your Gmail credentials. **Do not hardcode your password in the script.** Use environment variables or secure vaults to manage sensitive data.

```python
email_user = "your-email@gmail.com"
email_password = "your-secure-password"
```

### SMTP Settings

You can configure the SMTP settings as per your email provider's requirements. The default settings are for Gmail.

```python
smtp_server = 'smtp.gmail.com'
smtp_port = 465
```

### Image Attachment

Specify the path to the image you want to attach in your email.

```python
image_path = 'path/to/your/image.png'
```

## Customization

### Email Content

You can customize the email subject and body in the `send_email` function. The email content supports HTML formatting.

```python
subject = "Transform {company_name}â€™s Financial Management with Advanced AI Solutions"
body = f"""\
<html>
<body>
    <p>Dear {company_name} Team,</p>
    <!-- Custom content goes here -->
</body>
</html>
"""
```

### Adjusting Image Size

If you need to adjust the size of the image attachment, you can use the `PIL` (Python Imaging Library) to resize it before attaching.

```python
from PIL import Image

def resize_image(image_path, output_path, size):
    with Image.open(image_path) as img:
        img.thumbnail(size)
        img.save(output_path)

# Resize image to 300x300 pixels
resize_image('path/to/original.png', 'path/to/resized.png', (300, 300))
```

### Delay and Retry Mechanism

The script includes a delay mechanism to handle Gmail rate limits. You can adjust the delay time and retry attempts as needed.

```python
import time

def send_email_with_retry(email, company_name, retries=3, delay=60):
    for attempt in range(retries):
        try:
            send_email(email, company_name)
            break
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Attempt {attempt + 1} failed: {e}")
            time.sleep(delay)
```

### Logging and Debugging

Enable debug output to get detailed logs of the email sending process. This is helpful for troubleshooting issues.

```python
server.set_debuglevel(1)
```
